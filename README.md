# Minesweeper

The objective of the game is to clear a rectangular board containing hidden ”mines” without detonating any of them

# Personal Notes 

I have had experience with React and React Native while interning for an app developing company in India so I have used a lot of concepts I learned there into this application. Moreover, we were also taught Java in high-school for four years. So a lot of the code was just me writing it in Java and then asking chat GPT or going online to convert it into Kotlin. So I will admit that there are some aspects or code which I don't fully know the syntax of. But I still understand the entire chain of logic behind the application. Please let me know if you have any questions or concerns.  

# Getting Started 
You need to have android studio installed on your device and create an Android Virtual Device to run full Android OS and test the application.

## Installation 
- Clone the repository in a directory of your choice
- Open the Minesweeper folder with Android Studio
